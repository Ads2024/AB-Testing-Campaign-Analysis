# A/B Testing Campaign Analysis

A React-based dashboard for analyzing and visualizing A/B testing results from marketing campaigns. This analysis compares the performance of two marketing campaigns using A/B testing methodology. The control campaign represents the established approach, while the test campaign implements alternative strategies. Based on comprehensive analysis of key metrics, the **control campaign demonstrated better overall performance with an 11.34x ROAS compared to the test campaign's 10.17x ROAS**. However, the test campaign showed significant strengths in specific areas that could inform future optimization.
